When comes to active directory we've to mainly concentrate on Authentication & Autherization :
    Authentication :
        It mainly checks is it the right user? (valid credentials are not to login?)
    Autherization :
        Do they have right access ?
Through Azure AD, we can define users,credentials and their access rights.

Azure AD Connect : Synchronize on-prem active directory connection with Azure AD Directory 
    synchronize all user details with passwords
Azure AD MFA : Authenticate users in multiple ways
    something you know, typically a password
    something you have, a device 
    something you are, finger print or face scan
    (when MFA, we can use 2 of 3 above authentication methods)
Azure AD self service password reset : Azure Admins can give access to allow the users to reset the passwords by themselves 
![Alt text](image.png)
we can create groups, add users and roles.
Subscriptions also connected to active tenants in AD.
Azure AD domain services : azure AD is a toned down version of AD
    Does not provide all the features what AD provide.
    Azure AD is a Flat Structure where as AD is a Heirarchial Org units OU's and Group Policy Objects GPO's
    Azure AD is Web based protocals (Oauth,SAML,open Id) where as AD is Kerbaarose,LDAP,NTML
Role Based Access Control: RBAC
    Congigure Autherization 
    Role Assistance has 3 parts :
        1. Who? (Principal)
        2.What permission?(Role)
        3.What Scope?(Resource/Resource Group/Subscription/Management Group)
    RBAC can provide at any level.

Passwordless Authentication for Azure AD:(Still in progress )
    enable high security and high convenience 
    1. Windows Hello for business
    2. Microsoft Authenticator App
    3. FIDO2 security keys

When Azure Subscription Expires, Azure AD tenant is not deleted ,we can link it with a diff sibscription.

Multiple subscriptions can trust the same Azure AD directory. However, each subscription can only trust only one directory.
